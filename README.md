## Setup

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Download the contents of this folder based on which embeddings you're interested in trying out. This link has emebddings for BERT, GloVe, word2vec, fastText and dict2vec: https://drive.google.com/file/d/152QSA3yXK5x7z24DBPFuGW_-ynibTlRG/view?usp=sharing. If you're interested in using our DETECT method, you'll need to download `word_to_dict2vec_embeddings`.
